# Typed Python Language Rust Compiler

[ChocoPy](https://chocopy.org/) is a programming language designed for classroom use in undergraduate compilers courses. ChocoPy is a restricted subset of Python 3, which can easily be compiled to a target such as RISC-V. The language is fully specified using formal grammar, typing rules, and operational semantics. ChocoPy is used to teach CS 164 at UC Berkeley. ChocoPy has been designed by Rohan Padhye and Koushik Sen, with substantial contributions from Paul Hilfinger.

This is a Rust variant of the ChocoPy compiler created as part of the COMPSCI 164 class project that now targets x86.

## Get Started

To build the main compiler and standard library, run this in the base directory:

```bash
cargo build
```

Then use the compiler on the provided input files in the test/ directory, like so:

```bash
# Compile to executable output.exe, this compiler autodetects for your platform.
cargo run input.py output.exe

# Compile to object file output.o.
cargo run input.py output.o --obj

# Output untyped AST JSON to STDOUT.
cargo run input.py --ast

# Output typed AST JSON to STDOUT.
cargo run input.py --typed
```

- Features a hand written Rust lexer and parser. The parser is a left recursive parser with a look-ahead value of 2 to distinguish between declarations and statements.
- Supports outputting an intermediate AST representation of the code. This can be viewed directly through the CLI.
- Type checks the AST to predict and determine expected types for complex statements and declarations. Throws non-fatal type errors stored in the AST to see type errors in the input program. This can be viewed directly through the CLI.
- Generates x86 assembly code, and handles assembly (converting to an object file) on three different platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac.
- Handles linking against a separate create to represent a standard library. This library handles built-in function implementation, including object allocation and error reporting. This object allocation also executes the garbage collector.
- Implements the mark-and-sweep garbage collection algorithm. This garbage collector is called whenever a new object is allocated, and the total size of allocated objects reaches a threshold.
    - To do this, the system walks through all the objects that are heap allocated (global and local references) and marks which ones are currently being used. The system accomplishes this by storing a linked list of objects that are currently on the heap, to make it easy to track every dynamically allocated object.
    - The system also recursively tracks member object references within one particular object to mark non-global objects.
    - Then in the sweep phase, we walk through the heap linked list again and free all the un-marked objects.
